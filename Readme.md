# Interview App on Blockchain

Main Idea: The app exchange interview details (Q&A) between a jornalist and the person who is interviewed. The questions and answers are first encrypted due to a not be leaked before the publication. The jornalist set a deadline when the details of the interview will be public and the interviewed acept that before the exchange of questions and answers, all of that registrered in the bloackchain. The idea is to bring a transparent and public layer to the process it will help both sides to increase the credibility.

Some concepts behind could be the implementation of cryptographic ring signatures and unique one-time keys*. As they where first introduced with CryptoNote whitepaper in 2014 by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and the concept has been implemented in several cryptocurrencies such as Monero. Ring signatures were first proposed in 2001 by Dr Adi Shamir and others, building upon the group signature scheme that was introduced in 1991 by Dr Chaum and Eugene van Heyst.
