# Interview App on Blockchain

Main Idea: The app exchange interview details (Q&A) between a jornalist and the person who is interviewed. The questions and answers are first encrypted due to a not be leaked before the publication. The jornalist set a deadline when the details of the interview will be public and the interviewed acept that before the exchange of questions and answers, all of that registrered in the bloackchain. The idea is to bring a transparent and public layer to the process it will help both sides to increase the credibility.

Some concepts behind could be the implementation of unique one-time keys[1]. As they where first introduced with CryptoNote whitepaper in 2014 by Nicolas van Saberhagen, and the concept has been implemented in several cryptocurrencies such as Monero. But remember i'm just proposing an idea and had very vague knowledge in blockchain, don't know if this could be implemented.

PS: Any information here is just a Draft and is not ready for Production, i'am not a Javascript/Solidity/Blockchain developer yet.
