# Interview App on Blockchain

Main Idea: The app exchange interview details (Q&A) between a jornalist and the person who is interviewed. The questions and answers are first encrypted due to a not be leaked before the publication. The jornalist set a deadline when the details of the interview will be public and the interviewed acept that before the exchange of questions and answers, all of that registrered in the bloackchain. The idea is to bring a transparent and public layer to the process it will help both sides to increase the credibility.
